Please note that the qc flags associated with NEE filled using ANN are not exhaustive because the quality depends also by other aspects like the availability of data in the same period of the year and of the day that can be used for the training process.


NEE_st: Net Ecosystem Exchange standardized -  calculated using the storage obtained with the discrete approach (single point on the top of the tower) with the same method for all the sites

NEE_or: Net Ecosystem Exchange original -  calculated using the storage sent by the PI that can be obtained with the discrete approach or using the profile system



qf_NEE_st and qf_NEE_or quality flags explanation:
The qc_flag is a 9 bits number. See below the explanation:

Bit 9: QC from PI
0 = ok (class 0-1 of QA/QC method based on raw data – Foken et al.)
1 = not ok (class 2)

Bit 8: Marginal point  (at the border to a gap)
0 = no
1 = marginal point

Bits 7-6: ustar criterion
00 = ok
01 = below threshold
10 = preceding values is below threshold
11 = below threshold and preceding below threshold

Bits 5-4: Spike detection
00 = no spike
01 = spike as outside 4 SD
10 = spike as outside 5.5 SD
11 = spike as outside 7 SD or out of range.

Bit 3: Low variability
0 = ok
1 = low variability (e.g. when pump is broken etc.)

Bits 2-1: Summary
00 = best
01 = medium (not used)
10 = bad
11 = missing
