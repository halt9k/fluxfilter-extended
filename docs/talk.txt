Goals:
	Comprehensive, easy instrument both for scientific large data and new users having fun


Users:
	1) Students and non-programmes
	2) International collaborations with larger data (REddyProc)


Problems:
	1) Modularity of pipeline and each part
		1) Dergachiev:
			I don't want to use this part of pipeline
			I want (server?) run

	2) Version control overcomlicated at the very least for development,
		no binding of library versions and jupiter versions
		actions: leaks detection, colab pass test?


	3) Performance if main instrument (Google blocked, no buy !?)

	4) Support of complex scenarios via tests, including integration tests

	5) Logs: web server logs = must be part of library, not jupiter



changes:
	- large instrument - need faster processing

scenarios:
	- large library like REddyProc
	- web interface



colab:
	- Slow
	- Reset is extra source of glitches
	- Very bad integration to version control compared to SourceTree
	- No console for complicated investigations, why something is broken
	
	I.E. ONE WAY DEMO, no versions, no saving back to git

	
local jupiter:
	- also goo for experiments
